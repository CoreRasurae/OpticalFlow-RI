# OpticalFlow-RI (Reference Implementations) for Fluid Mechanics

OpticalFlow-RI is a source code repository of tested and validated optical flow algorithm implementations, being specificaly tuned for fluid mechanics applications with Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) image databases having a maximum displacement of 4.0px between frames.

This repository intends to be a reference library for reuse by anyone interested in evaluating said algorithms for fluid mechanics velocimetry applications. 

The library was created with minimal third-party dependencies for the relevant algorithms. This way it is less susceptible to unwanted behavioral changes that may arise by third-party libraries implementation changes/upgrades, ultimately leading to uncalibrated results or API breakage.

The library includes concrete examples on how to run the algorithms along with the calibration parameters. 


Current reference implementations include: Horn-Schunck (Python, Numba), Lucas-Kanade (Python, OpenCL), Farneb채ck (Python, OpenCL) and Liu-Shen Physics based optimizer (Python, Numba)

## Prerequisites
Python3 is required to run these algorithms.

Implementations tested with Ubuntu 20.04.2LTS and Ubuntu 21.04

Required packages include:
apt install python3 python3-numpy python3-skimage python3-pyopencl

*Note:* A valid OpenCL device is required to run dense Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunck algorithms. 

## Running the examples
There are a number of examples in the examples folder, namely:
